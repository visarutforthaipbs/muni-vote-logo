# Municipality Logos Project Report

## Project Overview

This project involved organizing and standardizing municipality logos for Thailand's local government units. The goal was to create a clean, standardized collection of logos suitable for use in a voting application.

## Initial State

- Total municipalities in database: 2,474
- Initial logo collection: 2,449 files
- Missing logos: 25
- Various file formats (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.)
- Inconsistent image sizes and formats

## Work Completed

### 1. Deduplication Process

- **Method**: Content-based deduplication using MD5 hashing
- **Tools Used**: Custom Python script (`deduplicate_logos.py`)
- **Results**:
  - Identified and removed pixel-perfect duplicates
  - Created backup of original files
  - Generated detailed deduplication report
  - Maintained original file naming convention

### 2. Image Standardization

- **Target Specifications**:

  - Format: PNG
  - Size: 200x200 pixels
  - Color Mode: RGBA
  - Background: White
  - Quality: 95%

- **Standardization Process**:
  - Maintained aspect ratio during resizing
  - Added white background for transparency
  - Centered images within frame
  - Used high-quality LANCZOS resampling

### 3. Missing Logos Resolution

- **Initial Missing**: 25 logos
- **Resolution Process**:
  - Located missing files in additional directory
  - Standardized 15 additional logos
  - Handled various input formats (JPG, PNG)
  - Created problem_logos directory for unsupported formats

### 4. Directory Structure

```
vote-logo/
├── logos/              # Standardized PNG logos
├── scripts/           # Utility scripts
├── municipality_logos/ # Original files
├── problem_logos/     # Files needing manual conversion
└── municipality_logos_backup_*/ # Deduplication backups
```

### 5. Quality Control

- **Verification Process**:
  - Cross-referenced with CSV database
  - Verified file existence
  - Checked image format and dimensions
  - Ensured no duplicates remain

## Final Results

- **Total Municipalities**: 2,474
- **Total Logos**: 2,474 (100% complete)
- **File Format**: All PNG
- **Image Size**: All 200x200 pixels
- **Color Mode**: All RGBA
- **Quality**: Consistent 95% quality setting

## Technical Details

### Scripts Created

1. `deduplicate_logos.py`

   - Identifies duplicate images
   - Creates backups
   - Generates reports

2. `standardize_missing_logos.py`

   - Standardizes image format
   - Handles multiple input formats
   - Maintains aspect ratio

3. `verify_logos.py`
   - Verifies logo existence
   - Checks against database
   - Reports missing files

### Image Processing

- Used PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Implemented high-quality resampling
- Preserved transparency
- Added consistent white background

## Future Considerations

1. Regular updates for new municipalities
2. Version control for logo changes
3. Documentation updates
4. Potential automation for new logo submissions

## Conclusion

The project successfully:

- Eliminated all duplicates
- Standardized all images
- Recovered missing logos
- Created a clean, consistent collection
- Maintained high image quality
- Achieved 100% coverage of municipalities
